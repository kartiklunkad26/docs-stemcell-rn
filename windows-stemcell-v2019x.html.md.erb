- Stembuild construct command can now identify the location of the base VM even in mulitple data centers. 
- Stembuild construct now logs out any users that might be logged in while the construct command is in progress to ensure minimum disruption during stemcell creation. 

**Deprecation Notice for Manual Stemcell Creation Process**

This release also marks the start of the depreciation period for manually creating stemcells using this procedure. Going forward only the stembuild-based approach will be supported. The manual creation of stemcells-based process will be removed by September, 2020. Please ensure to migrate to the above stembuild-based apprroach before then.

-  <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> versions v2.6.15, v2.7.11, or v2.8.6 and later.

### Security Fixes

- Includes [Microsoft Security Updates Patch Tuesday February 11, 2020](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4532691).
- For issues encountered with upgrading to the correct <%= vars.windows_runtime_abbr %> versions, see the following articles in the Knowledge Base:

### Features

- Supports signed URL capability. 
If Windows users opt in, the BOSH agent manages artifacts on the blobstore using signed URLs rather than blobstore credentials. 
For more information on how to opt in to signed URLs, see 
[Signed URLs](https://bosh.io/docs/director-blobstore-signed-urls/) in the _Cloud Foundry BOSH_ documentation.
- `stembuild` validates the VM OS is Windows Server 2019, OS build 17763. This is 
the only OS version that stembuild v2019.x is compatible with.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed a bug where `stembuild construct` did not execute successfully if it could not fetch 
updated root certificates from the public Windows Update Server. 
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You must manually update your certificates if your VM does not have 
  access to the public Windows Update Server.</p>
- Fixed a bug that tried to validate your VM credentials before connecting to the VM via WinRM. 
For more information on the original validation bug, see ["Validating connection to vm..." step fails during stembuild construct for Stembuild v2019.15]
